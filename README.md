# patterntestcase.cpp
This program prints a square star (*) pattern of size n Ã— n for multiple test cases. First, the user enters t (number of test cases). For each test case, it reads n and prints the star pattern. The outer loop in print1() controls the number of rows, while the inner loop prints stars in each row.
